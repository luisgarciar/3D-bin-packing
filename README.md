# 3D-bin-packing

Repository for the Capstone Project: Solving the 3D-bin-packing problem with reinforcement learning.

Group Members: Luis Garc√≠a Ramos, Przemyslaw Sekula

Data: 
The function `boxes_generator` in the file `utils.py` generates instances of the 3D Bin Packing problem using the algorithm described in [Ranked Reward: Enabling Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01672.pdf) (Algorithm 2, Appendix).
